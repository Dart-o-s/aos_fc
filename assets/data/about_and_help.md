Card/s: {p1}

To get back to the main screen, tap the left arrow in the navigation bar.

This app does not do much, it does for example not keep track about your progress. You have to be honest to your self. You can move cards around, at the moment in a limited way.

Use the bottom menu to load a fresh copy of the box of cards. If you make changes it will overwrite your copy in the devices Android folder.

You can insert/add a card at any place. Deleted cards get moved behind the special card *"$ Deleted"*.
You can completely delete them later.

## special marked cards
Cards with names like *"#1 Box One", "#2 ..."* etc. are markers for Boxes. With "long press" you get a menu to move a card to the next box. **Note:** *there is no space between the "#" and the number!*

Other special name sfor cards start with a dollar, for example: "$ Deleted", "$ End of Stack" (an end marker). Feel free to add as many numbered boxes or markers as you want. A future upgrade will let you move the current card freely into boxes.

## navigation
The *thumb down* symbol, moves a card to the first position in the box. As in: "you did not know it".
The *thumb up* symbol, only shows the next card. If you want to stop seeing this card, use the "long press" menu.

For example if you deleted a card by accident, you move with the *">>"* button forward until you find "$ Deleted". The deleted card will be behind that one. Then just use *" > "* to move to the card you want to "un-delete".

## go home
To get back to the main screen, tap the left arrow in the navigation bar.
