Card/s: {p1}

## Help
To get back to the main screen, tap the left arrow in the navigation bar.

This app does not do much, it does for example not keep track about your progress. You have to be honest to your self. You can move cards around, at the moment in a limited way.

Use the bottom menu to load a fresh copy of the box of cards. If you make changes it will overwrite your copy in the devices Downloads folder.

You can insert/add a card at any place. Deleted cards get moved behind the special card *"$ Deleted"*.
You can completely delete them later.

## Special marked cards
Cards with names like *"#1 Box One", "#2 ..."* etc. are markers for Boxes. With "long press" you get a menu to move a card to the next box. **Note:** *there is no space between the "#" and the number!*

Other special names for cards start with a dollar, for example: "$ Deleted", "$ End of File Marker" (an end marker). Feel free to add as many numbered boxes or markers as you want. A future upgrade will let you move the current card freely into boxes.

## Navigation
The *thumb down* symbol, moves a card to the first position in the first box. As in: "you did not know it".
The *thumb up* symbol, only shows the next card. If you want to stop seeing this card, use the "long press" menu.

For example if you deleted a card by accident, you move with the *">>"* button forward until you find "$ Deleted". The deleted card will be behind that one. Then just use *" > "* to move to the card you want to "un-delete".

## Random test mode
Activate via long press, pick the menu "Quizz!". Uncheck the menu when done.
The right *" > "* and left arrows *" < "* work like normal and move forward and backward, but the thumbs work slightly different. Thumbs down 👎 will move the card to the front, as usually, but will pick a random next card. Like wise thumbs up 👍 will keep the card where it is, and also pick a random next card.
