# we have a plan
    1) Play Trumpets! Realease 0.9.2
    2) migrating to objectbox and revamping live cycle: 0.9.3

## high prio items
    [X] DONE 2025-06-13 07:54 tag and push, r0.9.3
    [ ] OPEN does quickSave save the Flashcards or only the FlashCardFile?
        - I guess there is a conversion error

    [Y] DONE 2025-06-15 03:24 after moving all extensions to list<FlashCard>, check for quicksave();

### Refactorings around the old class Flashcard and the aqList
    [ ] OPEN - should have done this at the start of the project, haunted me since months

### The Assets do not have "meta cards"
    We have to add the meta cards when loading from the boxes, or before storing to the box
    [X] DONE 2025-06-15 01:04 when loading assets, add meta cards

### life cycle
    [x] DONE 2025-06-14 19:11 on launch check if "objectbox database" is set up, otherwise
        - copy assets to object box
    
    [O] OPEN select initial deck for learning
        [O] OPEN as this is a hobby project - I just open my thai page for now

### Menu to move Card to Chapters
    [X] DONE 2025-06-15 02:51 as the title says

### Menu to Jump to Chapters
    [ ] OPEN move the current "move card" ActionBar Menu into longpress?

### Rework the bottom bar three dot menu "..."
    [ ] OPEN move "About" into the "..." menu
    [ ] OPEN move tricky things into the long tap menu

### New Deck
    [X] DONE 2025-06-15 04:29 use "Import" Editor, for import 
        [X] add a menu or button to use file picker
        - perhaps adjust title
    [ ] OPEN creating new Decks?
        - load a template? Or have a clear button?
    [ ] OPEN edit current Deck in Editor

### Pick Deck 
    [X] DONE 2025-06-15 01:16 menu item to pick deck, list from box
            - we do not have many decks, so perhaps a menu is best for now
            - fix the filenames when importing into the boxes

    [ ] OPEN store needs to track which deck is open, for next session

### Export and Import/Merge via downloads
    [X] DONE 2025-06-15 04:43 import a file with file picker and import into current store/box
        [ ] OPEN set default from Downloads
    [ ] OPEN export a file (probably via file picker) to Downloads

### Abs File System
    [X] DONE 2025-06-15 04:45 Some methods (extensions to List<Flashcard>) got moved into AbsFileSystem, but they belong to "the App"
        [X] move them to flash_card.dart ... that should be good enough
    
    [o] OPEN upgrade AbsFileSystem to deal with objectbox
        - do we need that? Actually object box most likely completely replaces AbsFS
    
### Special Cards / Meta Cards
    [ ] OPEN put the card names into an enum

### Can we run a object box server locally, to fool around with the web version of this app
    - inprinciple we need a firebase set up or similar for the web version
    - for testing and development a local version is probably more cute, as we work often offline

## older high prio items, postponed during transition to object box
    [X] DONE 2025-06-14 19:45 trim the input field in the search box.
        Android auto completion adds a trailing space ...

    [O] DONE 2025-06-12 22:11 integrate object box
    [ ] fix git access on the Mac, it uses an old account, now angelosphere, which is the same as Dart-o-s is in the repro, too. 5555
    [ ] Initialize WebFileSystem only once.

        [?] I think I duplicated it to there, because the import did not work
            I believe I only need to refactor them out into its own file but give the extensions a name.

    [X] DONE 2025-04-23 18:15 test if I can copy my assests into downloads (Android)
            and modify them with an editor.
        Drawback: my Orgro saves with struggles ... and messes up data.

    [X] DONE 2025-05-07 11:11 (done long ago) confirmation dialog, before we overwrite the Downloads

    [X] DONE 2025-04-23 18:54 try to load from Downloads first, then load assets
        - that was the default
        - at the moment replacing the "installed" app via debugger keeps it able to 
            manipulate its file on ~/Downloads

    [X] DONE 2025-04-23 22:22 about page with build date and number of cards 
    [X] DONE 2025-04-23 22:24 help text, included in About Page 

    [X] BUG OPEN if there is no "$ Deleted " marker, inserting one and deleting the card mix their positions
    [X] FIXED 2025-04-23 22:38 left and right swipe swipe wrong.

    [X] DONE 2025-04-24 00:49 search ...
    [X] DONE 2025-04-24 02:25 import a file via copy/paste. 
        - Append or overwrite?
        + I decided to insert after first card
        Fixed font suze: style: CodeEditorStyle(fontSize: 24),

    [X] DONE 2025-05-07 11:11 known cards are not moved to higher boxes yet

    [X] DONE 2025-05-07 11:11 Google translate integration

    [X] DONE 2025-05-07 11:11 Simple Random Training
        - just pick a random card
        üëé moves to front, and picks another random one
        üëç just picks a new one.

    [ ] STB Look at this:
        dependencies:
            re_editor: ^0.0.3

    [X] DONE 2025-05-07 11:35 fix double snicker/snackbar about add and edit

    [ ] OPEN give file system permissions
        needed to copy assets to the work folder

    STB
    [ ] OPEN Code Generator - just write the menus and buttons, and generate a skelleton and backend for that
        first throw, mapping direct to controllers, second throw, mapping it to an eventbus and controllers listen

    [ ] OPEN put this in https://github.com/ivehement/saf

    [ ] OPEN copy search from Modro/orgro

### delayed
    [ ] clean up the stayed around methods working on the FlashCard List, e.g. fix $ Delete etc.
    [ ] Clean up script for plan.md, move all DONE items to the end
    [ ] OPEN ask for FileSystem permissions
        [ ] OPEN select files from filesystem

    [O] OPEN PWA / Web Storage
        does not work on Windows - stuff in the browser vanishes
        the "desktop installed app" does not launch
        [ ] OPEN lets try on Android as web page served from my laptop
        [ ] OPEN if web-storage does not work, lets try indexDB

    [X] DONE 2025-04-14 17:27 "move to front" menu item
        Solved: use "thumb down" for that

    [ ] OPEN Flavicon for Windows
    [X] DONE 2025-03-28 15:07 LOGO!
    [‚úî] DONE 2025-03-29 18:17 do the learning thing
    [‚úî] DONE 2025-03-29 18:18 add swipes later

    [X] DONE 2025-04-14 17:28 if Stack is empty, the first cards get added behind "$ Deleted", that is odd!!
        Not that odd: the bug happened when the "second last card" was selected/shown

    [ ] Memory like game based on this cards
        - place a set of cards double with opposing sides

    [X] Figure how to load/write from assets
        load is done, write is not possible, it seems

    [ ] OPEN figure if you can write into your privte store and read from it

## normal backlog
    [ ] OPEN intent_ns: ^2.0.0 fix it on github, after upgrading to high level Kotlin, it does not compiler\

    [X] DONE 2025-04-14 17:44 find "com.example.sample" and replace it with "priv.aos.aos_fc"
    [_] Check for scrollable Bottom Action Bar
        - Is a custom bar, probably not worth it ATM for this app 

    [X] DONE 2025-04-24 00:42 -long ago- Floating notification icon (up and down)
        replaced by snackbar ...

    [X] DONE 2025-04-24 00:41 -long ago - import the basic english word list
        - use the categories as starting blocks for new Ontologies
        - make other simple lists (German etc.)
        - upgrade the translator to do that - have the words marked ($, #)

    [X] DONE 2025-04-14 17:47 add boxes for short and long term memory
        - delete moves behind "$ Deleted"
        - DONE 2025-03-28 02:12 << previous chapter - or beginning if there is none
        - DONE 2025-03-28 02:12 >> next chapter - or end if there is none
        - DONE 2025-04-14 17:45 _undelete_ move current card to position 1
        - DONE 2025-04-14 17:46 perma delete by removing from the list

    [1] OPEN make a small frame around flip pane
        [‚úì] Tablet
        [‚úì] Windows
        [‚úÖ] Phone ‚úÖ ‚úî ‚úì üóπ
        [1] change colour on Tablet - probably based on device name?

    [ ] OPEN put on "New Flash Card" a google translate widget

## after first release
    [ ] OPEN figure how the files view on the tablet works, as orgro uses it as "save" dialog!
    [ ] OPEN share button via mail
    [ ] OPEN import
        - without merge
        - with merge
    [ ] mini MD parser - for settings / resp. use "Properties class" 
        # header
        [] checkbox
        - ignore rest

    [_] OPEN script to copy/merge the windows data file into Assets of the project. So it is in Git.
        - and can be distributed together with the App
        - the App should unpack the Asset to ~/Download

    [X] DONE 2025-03-28 15:26 after refactoring, creating a new Card does not directly move to it
        HINT: use await for Navigator.push() and put a setState() behind it.
        - for that comming back to the previous screen needs to make it repaint
            that is tricky and out of scope for today/tonight: just move to the next manually
        Look: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49804891/force-flutter-navigator-to-reload-state-when-popping 
            at: accepted answer

    [x] DONE 2025-03-28 00:42 add chapters - which are behind the boxes?
        [x] DONE 2025-03-28 00:42 Special Chapter "$ Deleted" for deleted Cards

    [x] DONE 2025-03-28 00:42 change the add option to "insert" at current position
    
    [X] DONE 2025-04-14 17:26 when inserting treat "# box" and "$ chapter" special
        - I think for now, "# Chapters" could be just placed before "$ Deleted"
        - "$ Chapters" just where the user puts them
        Solved: we just put them where the user is browsing

    [] OPEN make sure added cards contain no \n or \r
        perhaps in load and store, just replace?

    [x] DONE 2025-03-27 22:08 add arrows to browse from box to box 
    [o] OPEN add menu? "longpress?" for "ok" "not ok", "delete" and
        ok/not ok is not good for longpress, duration is to long
    [X] DONE 2025-06-13 06:11 "edit" is in the bottom menu (done long ago)

    [x] DONE 2025-03-27 15:54 change size of window on Windows
        DONE 2025-03-27 22:08 change width of center widget, see below

    [X] DONE 2025-03-29 00:41 figure why on Android the Flip Cart is to far on top
        - we figured if "width: property" is ommited, it resiszes horizontally quite nicely
            but the same does not work for "height:"
        = used an Expandable instead of a SizeBox. On the tablet perhaps to big.
    
    [X] DONE 2025-04-14 14:14 / long ago ... change the background colour on the eInk tablet
    
    [X] DONE 2025-04-14 17:18 set up a "snackbar" for short messages
        - ugly and floats to long, I think ...

    [ ] OPEN Search in Appbar
        https://pub.dev/packages/app_bar_with_search_switch

    [-] OPEN Copy to clipboard button as tap is used for flip
        [ ] delayed - we can go to "edit", copy there and abort

## unplanned items 
    - stuff we made without thinking
    - but want to keep track off, as it was a "distraction"

    [ ] BUG look for "print" and move it to the snack bar, especially "edit" is not "add"
        edid/add is probably fixed ...
